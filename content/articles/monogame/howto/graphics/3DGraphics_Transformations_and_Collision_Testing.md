# Transformations and Collision Testing

Provides classes and methods for manipulating vectors and matrices. This section discusses math and includes examples of common math-related game tasks.

# In This Section

  - [Positioning the Camera](HowTo_Position_the_Camera.md)  
    Demonstrates how to position the camera so that all objects in a scene are within the view frustum while maintaining the camera's original orientation.
  - [Transforming a Point](HowTo_TransformPoint.md)  
    This example demonstrates how to use the [Vector3](bb199670.md) and [Matrix](bb197911.md) classes to transform a point. A matrix transform can include scaling, rotating, and translating information.
  - [Rotating and Moving the Camera](HowTo_RotateMoveCamera.md)  
    Demonstrates how to rotate and move a camera in a 3D environment.
  - [Moving the Camera on a Curve](HowTo_ScriptedCamera.md)  
    Demonstrates how to use the [Curve](bb196070.md) and [CurveKey](bb196065.md) classes to move a camera along the shape of a curve.
  - [Selecting an Object with a Mouse](HowTo_Select_and_Object_with_a_Mouse.md)  
    Demonstrates how to check whether the mouse is positioned over a 3D object by creating a ray starting at the camera's near clipping plane and ending at its far clipping plane.
  - [Bounding Volumes and Collisions](HowTo_Bounding_Volumes_and_Collisions.md)  
    Collision detection determines whether objects in a game world overlap each other.
  - [Testing for Collisions](HowTo_Test_for_Collisions.md)  
    Demonstrates how to use the [BoundingSphere](bb195173.md) class to check whether two models are colliding.
