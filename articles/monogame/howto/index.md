# "How To" Articles for MonoGame

These articles provide a brief introduction into performing some basic tasks in MonoGame.

## In This Section

[How to create a Basic Effect](HowTo_Create_a_BasicEffect.md)

Demonstrates how to create and initialize an instance of the [BasicEffect](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.BasicEffect) class and use it to draw simple geometry.

[How to create a Render Target](HowTo_Create_a_RenderTarget.md)

Demonstrates how to create a render target using the [RenderTarget2D](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.RenderTarget2D) class.

[How to create a State Object](HowTo_Create_a_StateObject.md)

Demonstrates how to create a state object using any of the state object classes: [BlendState](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.BlendState), [DepthStencilState](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.DepthStencilState), [RasterizerState](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.RasterizerState), or [SamplerState](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.SamplerState).

[How to enable Antialiasing](HowTo_Enable_Anti_Aliasing.md)

Demonstrates how to enable antialiasing for your game.

[Positioning the Camera](HowTo_FitCameraToScene.md)

Demonstrates how to position the camera so that all objects in a scene are within the view frustum while maintaining the camera's original orientation.

[Transforming a Point](HowTo_TransformPoint.md)

This example demonstrates how to use the [Vector3](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Vector3) and [Matrix](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Matrix) classes to transform a point. A matrix transform can include scaling, rotating, and translating information.

[Rotating and Moving the Camera](HowTo_RotateMoveCamera.md)

Demonstrates how to rotate and move a camera in a 3D environment.

[Moving the Camera on a Curve](HowTo_ScriptedCamera.md)

Demonstrates how to use the [Curve](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Curve) and [CurveKey](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.CurveKey) classes to move a camera along the shape of a curve.

[Selecting an Object in 3D Space](HowTo_DetectClicked3DObject.md)

Demonstrates how to check whether the mouse (or touch location) is positioned over a 3D object by creating a ray starting at the camera's near clipping plane and ending at its far clipping plane.

[Bounding Volumes and Collisions](HowTo_CollisionDetectionOverview.md)

Collision detection determines whether objects in a game world overlap each other.

[Testing for Collisions](HowTo_DetectTwoObjectsColliding.md)

Demonstrates how to use the [BoundingSphere](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.BoundingSphere) class to check whether two models are colliding.

[How to detect a Key Press](HowTo_DetectKeyPress.md)

The code in this topic describes how to detect a key press or release on the keyboard.

[Detecting Gestures on a Multi-touch Screen](HowTo_GestureSupport.md)
